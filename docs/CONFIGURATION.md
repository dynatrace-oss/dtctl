# Configuration

## Authentication

### OAuth Login (Recommended)

Browser-based SSO login with automatic token refresh:

```bash
dtctl auth login --context my-env --environment "https://abc12345.apps.dynatrace.com"
```

Tokens are stored securely in your OS keyring. To log out:

```bash
dtctl auth logout
```

Check your current auth state with `dtctl auth status`, and force a token refresh with `dtctl auth refresh`.

### Non-Interactive OAuth (CI/CD)

Pipelines have no browser and no user, so the interactive login cannot complete
there. Supplying an OAuth client ID and secret switches `auth login` to the
OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant
([RFC 6749 §4.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-4.4)), which
needs neither:

```bash
export DTCTL_CLIENT_ID="dt0s02.EXAMPLE"
export DTCTL_CLIENT_SECRET="dt0s02.EXAMPLE.SECRET"
export DTCTL_ACCOUNT_URN="urn:dtaccount:00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
export DTCTL_TOKEN_STORAGE=file   # no keyring on a build agent

dtctl auth login \
  --context ci \
  --environment "https://abc12345.apps.dynatrace.com" \
  --scopes storage:logs:read
```

Prefer the environment variables over the equivalent `--client-id`,
`--client-secret` and `--account-urn` flags: command line arguments are visible
to every other process on the machine. Supplying only one half of the
credential pair — or an account URN or `--scopes` with no pair at all — is a
usage error rather than a silent fallback to the browser flow, which on a runner
would look like an unexplained hang.

This is a different credential type from the platform token below: the client
credentials grant needs an OAuth client (`dt0s02.` client ID **and** secret),
not a `dt0s16.` platform token.

How it differs from the interactive flow:

- **No user identity.** The grant authenticates the application, not a person,
  so the userinfo lookup is skipped and `dtctl auth whoami` has nothing to
  report.
- **`--safety-level` does not narrow the token.** It gates dtctl on the client
  side. Without `--scopes` the token carries every scope the OAuth client was
  granted, so `auth login` warns and prints the scopes the token actually came
  back with. Pass `--scopes`, or provision the OAuth client with only the
  scopes the pipeline needs.
- **No refresh token**, per
  [RFC 6749 §4.4.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-4.4.3) — a
  client holding its own credentials can just ask for another access token. So
  `dtctl auth refresh` cannot renew it and says so; re-run `dtctl auth login`
  instead.
- **`DTCTL_ACCOUNT_URN` is sent as an
  [RFC 8707](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707) resource indicator.**
  Omitting it sends no indicator at all, so the audience is whatever the token
  endpoint defaults to, rather than being bound to one environment the way an
  interactive token is.
- **`--timeout` (default `5m`) bounds the token request**, so a stalled token
  endpoint fails the pipeline step instead of holding the runner.

`DTCTL_TOKEN_STORAGE=file` is normally required alongside the credentials,
since build agents rarely have a keyring — see
[Credential storage](#credential-storage).

### Token-Based Auth

For CI/CD or headless environments, use a platform API token:

```bash
dtctl config set-context my-env \
  --environment "https://abc12345.apps.dynatrace.com" \
  --token-ref my-token

dtctl config set-credentials my-token \
  --token "dt0s16.XXXXXXXX.YYYYYYYY"
```

### Creating a Platform Token

1. Go to [https://myaccount.dynatrace.com/platformTokens](https://myaccount.dynatrace.com/platformTokens) (Account Management > **My platform tokens**)
2. Select **Platform token** and fill in name, expiration, account, and environments
3. Add the required scopes for your use case
4. Select **Generate** and copy the token immediately -- it's only shown once

See the [Dynatrace Platform Tokens documentation](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/manage/identity-access-management/access-tokens-and-oauth-clients/platform-tokens) for detailed instructions.

### Current User Identity

Check who you're authenticated as:

```bash
dtctl auth whoami
```

Use `dtctl auth whoami -o json` for machine-readable output, or `--id-only` to get just the user ID.

### Credential storage

OAuth and platform tokens are stored in your OS keyring (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service), never in plain text.

On **Linux and WSL**, gnome-keyring can start with only a transient session collection and no persistent login collection. When `dtctl auth login` detects a missing collection (`failed to unlock correct collection`), it connects to the D-Bus Secret Service, creates a persistent collection with the `default` alias, and triggers an OS password prompt if required (polling for up to two minutes). If automatic creation fails, the error message suggests alternatives such as token-based auth. `dtctl doctor` includes a keyring check that reports backend status.

Some keyring backends impose a per-item size limit, and a large OAuth response (many scopes or large JWTs) can exceed it. dtctl falls back automatically: it stores the full token set when it fits, drops the largest JWT fields when it does not, and in the worst case keeps only the refresh token and fetches a fresh access token on the next command. `dtctl auth login` therefore succeeds even when a size limit is reached, and tokens stay keyring-backed.

If you see `failed to save token to keyring: ... data passed to Set was too big`, a size limit was hit; dtctl falls back to compact storage automatically. Re-run `dtctl auth login --context <name> --environment <url>` if the error persists.

## Multiple Environments

### Create Contexts

```bash
# Development
dtctl config set-context dev \
  --environment "https://dev.apps.dynatrace.com" \
  --token-ref dev-token \
  --safety-level dangerously-unrestricted

# Production (read-only)
dtctl config set-context prod \
  --environment "https://prod.apps.dynatrace.com" \
  --token-ref prod-token \
  --safety-level readonly
```

### Switch Contexts

```bash
dtctl config use-context dev

# Or use the shortcut:
dtctl ctx dev

# List all contexts
dtctl ctx
```

The `ctx` command is a shorthand for the common `config` operations. With no
argument it lists contexts; with a name it switches. It also has subcommands:

```bash
dtctl ctx current                 # Show the current context name
dtctl ctx describe prod           # Show details of a context
dtctl ctx set staging \           # Create or update a context and switch to it
  --environment "https://staging.apps.dynatrace.com" --token-ref staging-token
dtctl ctx delete old-env          # Delete a context
dtctl ctx token prod              # Print the resolved token for a context (defaults to current)
```

### Delete Contexts and Credentials

Deleting a context leaves the credential it referenced in place, so removing
both is two decisions:

```bash
# Delete a context, keep the credential
dtctl config delete-context old-env

# Delete a context and the credential it references
dtctl config delete-context old-env --delete-credentials

# Delete a credential on its own (shared, or context already gone)
dtctl config delete-credentials old-token
```

`delete-context --delete-credentials` refuses as a no-op when the credential is
shared with other contexts, and the error names the command that removes it for
all of them. `delete-credentials` on its own always deletes, warning if a
context still points at the now-missing credential. Both honor `--dry-run`.

> Remove credentials only with these commands — they clear every entry a
> credential occupies, which a direct OS keychain delete does not. Never use
> `security`, `secret-tool`, or `cmdkey` on dtctl credentials. To confirm a
> credential is gone, use `dtctl auth status`, which reports presence without
> printing the token.

### One-Time Context Override

Run a single command against a different context without switching:

```bash
dtctl get workflows --context prod
```

## Per-Project Configuration

Create a `.dtctl.yaml` in your project root for team or CI/CD configuration:

```bash
dtctl config init
```

This generates a template with environment variable placeholders:

```yaml
apiVersion: dtctl.io/v1
kind: Config
current-context: production
contexts:
  - name: production
    context:
      environment: ${DT_ENVIRONMENT_URL}
      token-ref: my-token
      safety-level: readwrite-all
tokens:
  - name: my-token
    token: ${DT_API_TOKEN}
```

Commit the file to version control without secrets -- each developer or CI system provides values via environment variables.

### Config Search Order

1. `--config` flag (explicit path)
2. `DTCTL_CONFIG` environment variable (explicit path)
3. `.dtctl.yaml` in the current directory or any parent (walks up to root)
4. Global config (`~/.config/dtctl/config`)

> **Security: local configs cannot run commands.** Because a `.dtctl.yaml` is
> auto-discovered by walking up from your current directory, it is treated as
> **untrusted** -- the same threat model as a checked-out repo, an unpacked
> tarball, or a shared work dir. dtctl therefore **ignores command aliases and
> apply hooks** found in an auto-discovered local `.dtctl.yaml`, printing a
> warning to stderr when it does. These code-execution keys are honored **only**
> from the global config (`~/.config/dtctl/config`) or a config you point at

> contexts, tokens, and other preferences. As an additional safeguard, an alias
> can never shadow a built-in command (e.g. `get`, `apply`, `version`)
> regardless of where it is defined.

#### Trusting a prepared workspace with `DTCTL_CONFIG`

When you control the config file -- for example an automation harness that
generates a clean working directory with its own `.dtctl.yaml`, skills, and
hooks -- export `DTCTL_CONFIG` so dtctl treats that file as an explicit, trusted
config, exactly like `--config`:

```bash
export DTCTL_CONFIG="$PWD/.dtctl.yaml"
```

This honors the file's aliases and apply hooks without touching the invocation
(an agent can keep running `dtctl apply` unchanged), and it **skips
auto-discovery entirely** -- a stray `.dtctl.yaml` elsewhere on disk can never
shadow the file you named. Because it points at one specific file rather than
blanket-trusting whatever is discovered, it does not reopen the
untrusted-working-directory threat model above. Point it only at a config you
trust, and prefer scoping it to the session (e.g. exported by the harness or a
per-repo setup script) rather than your global shell profile.

### View the resolved configuration

To display the effective configuration after all files and overrides are merged:

```bash
dtctl config view
```

## Safety Levels

Safety levels provide **client-side** protection against accidental destructive operations:

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `readonly` | No modifications allowed |
| `readwrite-mine` | Modify your own resources only |
| `readwrite-all` | Modify all resources (default) |
| `dangerously-unrestricted` | All operations including bucket deletion |

```bash
dtctl config set-context prod \
  --environment "https://prod.apps.dynatrace.com" \
  --token-ref prod-token \
  --safety-level readonly
```

View context details including safety level:

```bash
dtctl config describe-context prod
```

Safety levels are client-side only. For actual security, configure your API tokens with minimum required scopes.

## Apply Hooks

Apply hooks run external commands around `dtctl apply`:

- **Pre-apply** (`pre-apply`): runs **before** the resource is sent to the API. Receives the processed JSON on stdin and can reject the apply (non-zero exit aborts).
- **Post-apply** (`post-apply`): runs **after** a successful apply. Receives the apply result as JSON on stdin. Useful for cleanup, notifications, or writing metadata to disk. A non-zero exit is reported as a warning -- the resource is already persisted.

Both hooks are invoked the same way: the command string is tokenized using POSIX-style shell quoting (so `"path with spaces"` and `'quoted args'` are honoured) and executed directly -- there is **no shell interpretation** of the command line itself. The resource type and source file are appended as the final two positional arguments.

### Configuration

Hooks are configured globally in `preferences` or per-context:

```yaml
# ~/.config/dtctl/config
preferences:
  hooks:
    pre-apply:  "node /opt/dtctl-hooks/validate.js"
    post-apply: "bash /opt/dtctl-hooks/notify.sh"

contexts:
  - name: production
    context:
      environment: https://abc12345.apps.dynatrace.com
      token-ref: prod-token
      hooks:
        pre-apply: "opa eval --bundle /policies -i /dev/stdin"
  - name: dev
    context:
      environment: https://dev.apps.dynatrace.com
      token-ref: dev-token
      hooks:
        pre-apply:  "none"  # explicitly disable the global hook
        post-apply: "none"
```

Per-context hooks take precedence over global hooks. The special value `"none"` disables the global hook for a specific context.

> **Security: hooks are ignored in local configs.** Apply hooks are honored only
> from the global config (`~/.config/dtctl/config`) or a config named explicitly
> with `--config` or `DTCTL_CONFIG`. Hooks defined in an auto-discovered local
> `.dtctl.yaml` (whether in
> `preferences` or a context) are **ignored**, since a local config from an
> untrusted working directory must not be able to run commands. dtctl prints a
> warning to stderr when it ignores them. (The hook values remain in the file
> untouched -- they are simply never executed -- so editing the config elsewhere
> never destroys them.) See [Config Search Order](#config-search-order).

### Hook Contract

| Aspect | Pre-apply | Post-apply |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Invocation** | direct exec of the tokenized command, with `<resource-type>` and `<source-file>` appended as args | same |
| **$1** | Resource type (e.g., `dashboard`, `workflow`, `slo`) | same |
| **$2** | Source filename from `-f` | same |
| **Stdin** | Processed resource JSON (YAML→JSON + template rendering applied) | Apply result JSON (array of per-resource result objects: `action`, `resourceType`, `id`, `name`, etc.) |
| **Stdout** | Always forwarded to the user's stdout | Forwarded to the user's stdout |
| **Stderr** | Always forwarded to the user's stderr | Always forwarded to the user's stderr |
| **Exit 0** | Proceed with apply | Reported as success |
| **Exit non-zero** | Abort apply, show stdout+stderr | Warning only -- apply already succeeded; stdout+stderr are shown and a warning line is printed |
| **Timeout** | 30 seconds | 30 seconds |
| **Dry-run** | Pre-apply runs (validates before the preview) | Post-apply is skipped |
| **Array apply (partial failure)** | Runs once on the full array | Runs once on the resources that *were* persisted, even when later items in the batch fail |

Because the command is tokenized but then executed directly (no `sh -c`), pipes, redirections, glob expansion, and environment-variable expansion in the command string itself are **not** supported -- put any shell logic inside the script the hook invokes.

> **Agent mode (`--agent` / `-A`).** When dtctl writes its JSON envelope to stdout, both pre-apply and post-apply hook output is redirected to stderr automatically so the envelope on stdout stays clean for machine consumers. Use stderr for any human-readable hook diagnostics.
>
> **Shell positional parameters in config values.** The config loader expands `$VAR` / `${VAR}` against the process environment but preserves shell positional parameters (`$1`, `$2`, `$@`, …) verbatim. You can write `pre-apply: "bash validate.sh \"$1\" \"$2\""` and have those tokens reach the hook unchanged.

### Writing Hooks

**Pre-apply** -- reject dashboards without a title:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# validate.sh
resource_type="$1"

if [ "$resource_type" = "dashboard" ]; then
  title=$(cat | jq -r '.title // empty')
  if [ -z "$title" ]; then
    echo "Error: dashboard must have a title" >&2
    exit 1
  fi
fi
```

**Post-apply** -- delete the source file after a successful dashboard deploy, forcing the user to re-download before the next edit:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# cleanup.sh
resource_type="$1"
source_file="$2"

if [ "$resource_type" = "dashboard" ] && [ -f "$source_file" ]; then
  rm -- "$source_file"
  id=$(cat | jq -r '.[0].id')
  echo "Deployed dashboard $id. Local file removed; re-download with 'dtctl get dashboard $id' before the next edit."
fi
```

### Usage

```bash
dtctl apply -f dashboard.yaml            # pre- and post-apply both run
dtctl apply -f dashboard.yaml --no-hooks # skip both hooks
dtctl apply -f dashboard.yaml --dry-run  # pre-apply runs, post-apply is skipped
dtctl apply -f dashboard.yaml -v         # verbose: logs hook command and duration
```

## Result Spill

`dtctl query` can spill a large result to a local file (see the `dtctl inspect`
command in [COMMANDS.md](COMMANDS.md)) and return a compact summary
instead of the rows. Defaults can be set globally or per-context under a
`spill:` section:

```yaml
# ~/.config/dtctl/config  (global, or under a specific context)
spill:
  mode: auto            # auto | always | never  (overrides the agent/non-agent default)
  dir: ~/.cache/dtctl/results   # base directory for spilled files
  format: jsonl         # jsonl | json | csv | parquet
  threshold: 50KB       # serialised output size that triggers a spill
  ttl: 24h              # how long spilled files are kept before pruning
```

Environment overrides (handy for containers/CI):

```bash
export DTCTL_SPILL=never                 # auto | always | never — kill switch for disk writes
export DTCTL_SPILL_DIR=/mnt/scratch      # write spills to a mounted volume
```

Precedence (highest wins): **flag → environment → context config → global config →
built-in default**. A user-chosen `dir` (or `DTCTL_SPILL_DIR` / `--spill-to`) is
written outside the managed cache and opts out of its TTL pruning and per-context
partitioning -- you own that file's lifetime.

## Query Limits

Every query dtctl runs can carry per-query caps -- the same knobs `dtctl query`
exposes as flags. Setting them in the config makes them apply to *every* query
in a context, including generated ones, scripts, and agent-driven runs, which a
flag you have to remember to type does not.

```yaml
# ~/.config/dtctl/config
query-limits:                 # global defaults
  scan-limit-gbytes: 500      # cap the data scanned (PARTIAL result beyond it)
  max-result-records: 5000    # cap returned records (0 = server default, ~1000)
  max-result-bytes: 10485760  # cap result size in bytes
  sampling-ratio: 0           # DQL sampling on log/span fetches (0 = off)

contexts:
  - name: production
    context:
      environment: https://abc12345.apps.dynatrace.com
      token-ref: production
      query-limits:
        scan-limit-gbytes: 50   # tighter ceiling here; other limits inherited
  - name: sandbox
    context:
      environment: https://sandbox.apps.dynatrace.com
      token-ref: sandbox
      # no query-limits block: inherits the global defaults
```

Precedence (highest wins): **flag -> context config -> global config -> server
default**. The per-context block overrides the global one **per field**, so a
context can tighten one limit without restating the others.

A limit is only ever applied when it is set: a config without a `query-limits`
block behaves exactly as it did before the section existed, and an explicit
`--default-scan-limit-gbytes 0` still means "use the server default" rather than
inheriting the configured ceiling.

Because zero means "defer to the next layer" at every config layer, the merge
only ever tightens: a context can lower a global ceiling but cannot lift one,
and a negative value is rejected rather than silently ignored. Lifting a
configured limit is a command-line decision:

```bash
dtctl query 'fetch logs, from:now()-30d | summarize count()' --no-query-limits
```

`--no-query-limits` drops the config layers only -- limit flags you pass on the
same command line still apply, so `--no-query-limits --max-result-records 42`
means "ignore the config, use 42".

Two caveats worth knowing:

- **`scan-limit-gbytes` is a brake, not a filter.** Exceeding it returns a
  PARTIAL result rather than an error. dtctl says so on every affected query
  (and, with `-v`, names the configured limits it applied), but a script that
  ignores the warning will read a truncated answer as a complete one.
- **`sampling-ratio` makes results approximate** for every query in the context,
  not just the wide ones -- counts come back extrapolated. Prefer setting it per
  query unless approximate answers are what the whole context is for.

Limits apply to `dtctl query` and `dtctl wait query`. `dtctl inventory` keeps its
own discovery cap (`--scan-limit-gbytes`, default 25).

## Command Aliases

Create shortcuts for frequently used commands.

### Simple Aliases

```bash
dtctl alias set wf "get workflows"
dtctl wf
# Expands to: dtctl get workflows
```

### Parameterized Aliases

Use `$1`-`$9` for positional parameters:

```bash
dtctl alias set logs-errors "query 'fetch logs | filter status=\$1 | limit 100'"
dtctl logs-errors ERROR
# Expands to: dtctl query 'fetch logs | filter status=ERROR | limit 100'
```

### Shell Aliases

Prefix with `!` to execute through the system shell (enables pipes and external tools):

```bash
dtctl alias set wf-names "!dtctl get workflows -o json | jq -r '.workflows[].title'"
dtctl wf-names
```

### Import and Export

Share aliases with your team:

```bash
dtctl alias export -f team-aliases.yaml
dtctl alias import -f team-aliases.yaml
```

### Managing Aliases

```bash
dtctl alias list         # List all aliases
dtctl alias delete wf    # Delete an alias
```

### Alias Safety

Aliases cannot shadow built-in commands:

```bash
dtctl alias set get "query 'fetch logs'"
# Error: alias name "get" conflicts with built-in command
```

This guard is also enforced at **resolution** time: even an alias written
directly into a config file (bypassing `alias set`) can never override a
built-in -- dtctl ignores it and runs the real command, warning on stderr.

Aliases are honored only from the global config or a config named explicitly
with `--config` or `DTCTL_CONFIG`.
Aliases in an auto-discovered local `.dtctl.yaml` are **ignored** for security
(see [Config Search Order](#config-search-order)), so `alias export` / `import`
should target the global config, not a per-project file.

## Command Profiles

Command profiles restrict **which commands dtctl exposes** to a named subset. A
profile shapes every discovery surface at once -- `--help`, the
[`dtctl commands`](AGENT_MODE.md#command-catalog) catalog, and shell completion -- and hard-blocks
invocation of anything outside the set.

The motivating use case is embedding dtctl in AI agents. When only a slice of the
CLI is relevant -- say an investigation agent that needs `query` and Davis
analyzers but never `auth login` or the cloud-provisioning verbs -- a large,
mostly-irrelevant command menu confuses the agent. A profile trims the surface to
what matters, from configuration alone. No fork, one binary.

> **Profiles are a convenience, not a security boundary.** Like
> [safety levels](#profiles-vs-safety-levels), they are client-side. A determined
> caller can unset `DTCTL_PROFILE` or edit the config. For real restriction,
> scope the API token.

### Quick start

Bind a built-in profile to a context so an embedded agent inherits the reduced
surface with zero flags:

```bash
dtctl config set-context prod-agent \
  --environment https://abc12345.apps.dynatrace.com \
  --token-ref prod-token \
  --profile query \
  --safety-level readonly

# Now the agent only sees the query surface:
dtctl commands            # catalog reflects the profile
dtctl --help              # help reflects the profile
dtctl auth login          # blocked with a clear error
```

Or select a profile for a single controlled environment via the environment
variable, which takes precedence over any context binding:

```bash
DTCTL_PROFILE=query dtctl commands
```

### Built-in profiles

| Profile | Surface (plus always-available commands) |
|---------|------------------------------------------|
| `full` | Everything (the default; today's behavior) |
| `query` | `query`, `get analyzers`, `describe analyzer`, `exec analyzer`, `verify analyzer` |
| `investigate` | `query`, `logs`, `get`, `find`, `describe` |

Profile names are deliberately **topical**, never permission words like
`readonly` -- that axis belongs to safety levels (see below). If a profile should
also forbid writes, pair it with `--safety-level readonly` on the context.

### Defining your own

Profiles live in the config file under a top-level `profiles` map. A profile is a
`description` plus a flat `commands` **allowlist**:

```yaml
profiles:
  triage:
    description: Read-only incident triage for on-call agents
    commands:
      - query
      - logs
      - get slos      # only SLOs from the get verb, not all of `get`
      - describe

contexts:
  - name: oncall-agent
    context:
      environment: https://abc12345.apps.dynatrace.com
      token-ref: oncall-token
      profile: triage
      safety-level: readonly
```

Matching rules:

- Each `commands` entry is a **command-path prefix**: a verb (`query`), a
  resource (`get workflows`), or a full path. An entry matches a command when it
  equals or is a segment-prefix of that command's path, so listing a parent verb
  (`describe`) includes its whole subtree.
- **Default-deny**: anything not matched (and not always-available) is masked.
  There is no denylist -- you always list what is *allowed*. Adding a new command
  to dtctl never silently widens an existing profile.
- To allow a parent but only some children, list the specific child paths
  (`commands: [get analyzers, get slos]` rather than `commands: [get]`).

User-defined profiles take precedence over a built-in preset of the same name.

### Always-available commands

Only two commands are allowed regardless of profile -- the irreducible core that
lets an agent discover its surface and a user get help:

- `commands` (and `commands howto`) -- the machine-readable catalog agents
  bootstrap from
- `help`

Everything else is subject to the allowlist, **including `config`, `ctx`,
`completion`, and `version`**. This is deliberate: `config`/`ctx` can rotate
credentials and switch environments, so a locked-down agent profile must be able
to withhold them. If a profile needs any of these, list it explicitly (e.g.
`commands: [query, config]`).

### Selecting the active profile

Precedence, highest first:

```
DTCTL_PROFILE env  >  context-bound profile  >  none (= full)
```

- **`DTCTL_PROFILE`** -- for products that wrap the binary in a controlled
  environment.
- **Context binding** (`--profile` on `set-context`) -- the recommended path for
  embedding; agents inherit the surface with zero flags.
- **None** -- the full command tree (default, fully backward compatible).

There is no global default-profile setting: a config-wide profile is a footgun
(set once, forgotten, every invocation silently restricted). Activation is always
explicit per-environment or scoped to a context.

### What a blocked invocation looks like

```
$ DTCTL_PROFILE=query dtctl auth login
Error: command "auth login" is not available in profile "query"

  This profile exposes a reduced command set. Run 'dtctl commands' to see
  what is available, or unset DTCTL_PROFILE to use the full CLI.
```

In [agent mode](AGENT_MODE.md) the same block is reported as a structured error
with `code: "profile_blocked"`. The `dtctl commands` catalog also advertises the
active `profile` and `safety_level` so an agent can see both constraints at once.

Masks **compose**: a command has to survive every active mask to be invocable, and
the code you get back names the mask that stopped it. In server mode, for
example, the per-request profile and the service's own host-only-command mask
both apply, so `config` reports `unsupported_in_service` no matter which profile
is active.

### Profiles vs. safety levels

Profiles and [safety levels](#safety-levels) are **orthogonal axes**
that compose on a context:

| | Safety level | Profile |
|---|---|---|
| Question | "What may this command *do*?" | "Which commands *exist* here?" |
| Axis | Permission / blast radius | Topic / surface |
| Effect on help & catalog | None -- blocks at run time | Removes the command entirely |

> A profile decides which commands are on the menu; the safety level decides what
> those commands are allowed to do.

Set **both** on a context to express, e.g., "this agent only sees `query`/Davis
analyzers **and** can never mutate."

Two further axes exist when dtctl is not a local terminal process -- they belong to
the *environment* it runs in, not to your configuration, and they matter because
an agent has to tell all four blocks apart:

| Axis | Question | Chosen by | Agent code (see [AGENT_MODE.md](AGENT_MODE.md#error-responses)) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Safety level | "What may this command *do*?" | context, `--safety-level`, or the request | `safety_blocked` |
| Profile | "Which commands *exist* for this caller?" | `DTCTL_PROFILE`, context, or the request | `profile_blocked` |
| Environment | "Which commands *make sense* here at all?" | the embedding environment -- server mode removes host-only commands (`config`, `ctx`, `auth`, …) | `unsupported_in_service` |
| Capability | "Which *host abilities* may this process use?" | the embedding host -- plugins, aliases, hooks, editors, and browser opens are all off for embedded callers | `capability_disabled` |

The environment and capability axes are not configurable from a context: a service
sets them once for its whole process, and they compose with whatever profile and
safety level a request carries.
