## Overview

dtctl supports configuring cloud monitoring integrations for AWS, Azure, and GCP (GCP support is currently in Preview). Each integration follows a connection-then-configuration pattern: first establish a connection with credentials, then create a monitoring configuration that defines what to monitor. Monitoring configurations are always created in a **disabled** state; a separate `dtctl enable` step activates them.

## Supported operations

There is no dedicated `aws`/`azure`/`gcp` resource type in the command catalog. These operations are exposed as their own verb + noun-phrase pairs (`create aws connection`, `create azure monitoring`, `enable gcp monitoring`, ...) layered over the Settings API, rather than generic `get`/`create`/`delete` on a single resource name.

## Flags

Resource commands take dtctl's **global flags** (`-o/--output`, `--dry-run`, `--context`, `--jq`, `-v`, ...). Cloud-integration commands add their own noun-specific flags, such as `--name`, `--regions`, `--featureSets`, `--credentials`, `--roleArn` (AWS), `--type`, `--directoryId`, `--applicationId`, `--clientSecret`, `--locationFiltering` (Azure), and `--serviceAccountId` (GCP connections), plus `--credentials`, `--locationFiltering`, and `--featureSets` (GCP monitoring). See the examples below for their usage in context.

## Required token scopes

Cloud integration connections and monitoring configurations are managed through the Settings API and, for the underlying extension configuration, the Extensions API:

| Safety level | Scopes |
| --- | --- |
| read | `settings:objects:read`, `extensions:configurations:read` |
| write | `settings:objects:write`, `extensions:configurations:write` |

## Output

`create`/`update` commands print the created or updated object's identifying fields; `create aws connection` and `create azure connection` additionally print copy-paste setup material (a CloudFormation snippet for AWS; Issuer/Subject/Audiences values for Azure federated identity). `get aws monitoring-regions`, `get aws monitoring-feature-sets`, `get gcp monitoring-locations`, and `get gcp monitoring-feature-sets` print the discoverable values needed for the `--regions`, `--featureSets`, and `--locationFiltering` flags elsewhere in the workflow.

## Examples

### AWS monitoring

AWS monitoring uses role-based authentication: the connection's `objectId` becomes `sts:ExternalId` in the IAM role's trust policy, provisioned via a Dynatrace-maintained CloudFormation template.

```bash
# Step 1: create the connection first — the role ARN is patched in later
dtctl create aws connection --name "my-aws-connection"
```

The command prints a copy-paste `aws cloudformation deploy` snippet that creates the IAM role using the connection's `objectId` as `sts:ExternalId`. Run it in AWS CloudShell, then patch the resulting role ARN into the connection:

```bash
dtctl update aws connection --name "my-aws-connection" --roleArn "$ROLE_ARN"
```

Create a monitoring configuration (`--regions` is required; `--featureSets` is optional and defaults to the extension's default set). Monitoring configurations are created disabled:

```bash
dtctl create aws monitoring --name "my-aws-monitoring" \
  --credentials "my-aws-connection" \
  --regions us-east-1,eu-central-1
```

Discover regions and feature sets, then enable:

```bash
dtctl get aws monitoring-regions
dtctl get aws monitoring-feature-sets

dtctl enable aws monitoring --name "my-aws-monitoring"

# Or patch the role ARN and enable in one step:
dtctl enable aws monitoring --name "my-aws-monitoring" \
  --roleArn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/DynatraceMonitoringRole
```

Update and delete:

```bash
dtctl update aws monitoring --name "my-aws-monitoring" \
  --regions us-east-1,eu-central-1,ap-southeast-2 \
  --featureSets EC2_essential,RDS_essential

dtctl delete aws monitoring my-aws-monitoring
dtctl delete aws connection my-aws-connection
```

### Azure monitoring

dtctl supports two Azure authentication types: `federatedIdentityCredential` (recommended, no long-lived secrets) and `clientSecret` (service principal with a password).

```bash
# Create the service principal and assign the Reader role
CLIENT_ID=$(az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "$CONNECTION_NAME" --create-password false --query appId -o tsv)
az role assignment create --assignee "$CLIENT_ID" --role Reader --scope "/subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID"

# Create the connection — its ID becomes the federated credential subject
dtctl create azure connection --name "$CONNECTION_NAME" --type federatedIdentityCredential
```

`dtctl create azure connection` prints the Issuer, Subject, and Audiences values (and a ready-to-run `az` command) to add as a federated credential in Entra ID. Then finalize:

```bash
dtctl update azure connection \
  --name "$CONNECTION_NAME" \
  --directoryId "$TENANT_ID" \
  --applicationId "$CLIENT_ID"
```

For the `clientSecret` type, create the connection with the secret directly:

```bash
dtctl create azure connection \
  --name "$CONNECTION_NAME" \
  --type clientSecret \
  --directoryId "$TENANT_ID" \
  --applicationId "$CLIENT_ID" \
  --clientSecret "$CLIENT_SECRET"
```

Create a monitoring configuration (created disabled), optionally scoped to regions/feature sets, then enable:

```bash
dtctl create azure monitoring \
  --name "$CONNECTION_NAME" \
  --credentials "$CONNECTION_NAME" \
  --locationFiltering westeurope,northeurope \
  --featureSets microsoft_compute.virtualmachines_essential

dtctl enable azure monitoring --name "$CONNECTION_NAME"
```

Rotate an expired client secret with `--append`, so the old secret stays valid until you cut over:

```bash
NEW_SECRET=$(az ad app credential reset --id "$CLIENT_ID" --append \
  --display-name "dtctl-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)" --query password -o tsv)

dtctl update azure connection --name "$CONNECTION_NAME" --clientSecret "$NEW_SECRET"
```

Update and delete:

```bash
dtctl update azure monitoring "$CONNECTION_NAME" \
  --locationFiltering westeurope,northeurope \
  --featureSets microsoft_compute.virtualmachines_essential

dtctl delete azure monitoring "$CONNECTION_NAME"
dtctl delete azure connection "$CONNECTION_NAME"
```

### GCP monitoring (Preview)

```bash
# Create the connection, then set up a GCP service account with gcloud
dtctl create gcp connection --name "my-gcp-connection"

gcloud iam service-accounts create dynatrace-monitoring --display-name "Dynatrace Monitoring"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <project-id> \
  --member "serviceAccount:dynatrace-monitoring@<project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role "roles/monitoring.viewer"

# Set the service account email on the connection
dtctl update gcp connection \
  --name "my-gcp-connection" \
  --serviceAccountId "dynatrace-monitoring@<project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com"

# Create a monitoring configuration against the connection (created disabled)
dtctl create gcp monitoring --name "my-gcp-monitoring" --credentials "my-gcp-connection"

# Discover locations and feature sets
dtctl get gcp monitoring-locations
dtctl get gcp monitoring-feature-sets

# Enable
dtctl enable gcp monitoring --name "my-gcp-monitoring"
```

Update and delete:

```bash
dtctl update gcp monitoring --name "my-gcp-monitoring" \
  --locationFiltering us-central1,europe-west1

dtctl delete gcp monitoring my-gcp-monitoring
dtctl delete gcp connection my-gcp-connection
```

## Notes

### AWS: IAM role deployment script

The connection command prints a ready-to-run snippet, but the underlying script is worth knowing if you need to adapt it (for example, to change the stack name or region). It downloads Dynatrace's least-privilege role template and deploys it as a CloudFormation stack, then reads the role ARN back out of the stack outputs:

```bash
STACK="dynatrace-monitoring-my-aws-connection"
curl -fsSLo da-role.yaml https://dynatrace-data-acquisition.s3.amazonaws.com/aws/deployment/cfn/latest/da-aws-nested-monitoring-role.yaml
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --stack-name "$STACK" \
  --template-file da-role.yaml \
  --parameter-overrides pDynatraceUrl=<your-tenant-url> pRoleExternalId=<connection-object-id> \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM

ROLE_ARN=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name "$STACK" \
  --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='DynatraceMonitoringRoleArn'].OutputValue" --output text)
```

Run this in AWS CloudShell. The stack name follows the pattern `dynatrace-monitoring-<connection-name>`, which keeps it identifiable if you manage multiple AWS connections. `pRoleExternalId` must be the connection's `objectId`, and `pDynatraceUrl` is your tenant URL. `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM` is required because the template creates a named IAM role.

### Azure: choosing and naming the subscription

Before creating an Azure connection, pick the subscription you want to monitor and derive a connection name from it. Naming the connection after the subscription keeps multiple connections easy to tell apart:

```bash
az account list --output table

SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query id -o tsv)
SUBSCRIPTION_NAME=$(az account show --query name -o tsv)
TENANT_ID=$(az account show --query tenantId -o tsv)

# Subscription names can contain spaces. Normalize them to dashes.
CONNECTION_NAME="dtctl-$(echo "$SUBSCRIPTION_NAME" | tr ' ' '-')"
```

### Multiple subscriptions

Both Azure authentication types (federated identity and client secret) use a single service principal that can be granted the Reader role on more than one subscription. Repeat the `az role assignment create` command, once per additional subscription, against the same `$CLIENT_ID`, rather than creating a separate service principal for each one.

### Azure: security considerations for client secrets

`az ad sp create-for-rbac` prints the client secret only once, so capture it immediately when creating a service principal for the `clientSecret` authentication type.

When you pass `--clientSecret` to `dtctl`, the value doesn't touch bash history or disk, but it can still be visible in the `dtctl` process arguments while the command runs. Avoid running this on shared machines, and be aware of any process-argument logging in your environment.

### GCP: workload identity federation setup

After creating the service account and granting it the monitoring viewer role, you still need to configure workload identity federation or impersonation so that Dynatrace can assume the service account. Run `dtctl describe gcp connection` after creating the connection; it prints the specific instructions for this step.
