# Token Scopes Reference

This document lists the Dynatrace platform token scopes required for each safety level. Copy the scope list for your desired safety level when creating a token in Dynatrace.

> **Note**: Safety levels are client-side only. The token scopes you configure in Dynatrace are what actually controls access. Configure your tokens with the minimum required scopes for your use case.
>
> **Ownership checks are also client-side**: The `readwrite-mine` safety level and `--mine` flag work by comparing the resource owner ID with your user ID locally. The Dynatrace API does not enforce ownership restrictions—if your token has write access, you can modify any resource that is shared with a user. The ownership check is a convenience feature to prevent accidental modifications to shared resources.
>
> **Machine-readable source of truth**: The per-level lists and the per-resource scopes below are derived from a single canonical table (`pkg/auth/resource_scopes.go`); `GetScopesForSafetyLevel` and the command catalog both read from it, so they cannot drift. `dtctl commands -o json` exposes that table as a top-level `resource_scopes` object plus per-command `required_scopes_by_resource`, and `dtctl commands [filter] --required-scopes` prints the minimal scope union for a command set. Prefer these over hand-copying this document when provisioning tokens programmatically.

## Quick Reference

| Safety Level               | Use Case                               | Token Type        |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `readonly`                 | Production monitoring, troubleshooting | Read-only token   |
| `readwrite-mine`           | Personal development, sandbox          | Standard token    |
| `readwrite-all`            | Team environments, administration      | Standard token    |
| `dangerously-unrestricted` | Dev environments, bucket management    | Full access token |

For creating platform tokens, see [Dynatrace Platform Tokens documentation](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/manage/identity-access-management/access-tokens-and-oauth-clients/platform-tokens).

## Recommended Scopes by Safety Level

### `readonly`

Read-only access for production monitoring and troubleshooting.

This level does not include the Live Debugger write scope `dev-obs:breakpoints:set`.

## Scopes by resource

Required scopes for every resource are generated from the CLI below (grouped by access level), and each resource page under [`resources/`](resources/) lists its own **Required token scopes** table.

<!-- GENERATED:token-scopes:start -->
<!-- Do not edit by hand. Generated by scripts/gen-docs from `dtctl commands --full -o json`; run `make docs-generate`. -->

## Required scopes by resource (generated)
