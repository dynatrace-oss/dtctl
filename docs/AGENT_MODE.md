# AI Agent Mode

dtctl provides first-class support for AI coding agents with a structured JSON output mode, automatic environment detection, and a machine-readable command catalog.

## Overview

The `--agent` (or `-A`) flag wraps all dtctl output in a structured JSON envelope:

```bash
dtctl get workflows --agent
```

This makes it straightforward for AI agents to parse responses, handle errors, and discover follow-up actions without scraping human-readable text.

## Response Format

### Successful responses

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "result": [
    {
      "id": "wf-abc123",
      "name": "Daily Health Check",
      "state": "enabled"
    }
  ],
  "context": {
    "verb": "get",
    "resource": "workflow",
    "suggestions": [
      "dtctl describe workflow wf-abc123",
      "dtctl exec workflow wf-abc123"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Error responses

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "auth_required",
    "message": "No valid authentication found. Run 'dtctl auth login' or configure a token.",
    "suggestions": [
      "dtctl auth login --context my-env --environment https://abc12345.apps.dynatrace.com",
      "dtctl config set-credentials my-token --token <your-token>"
    ]
  }
}
```

Error codes are stable identifiers that agents can match on programmatically:

| Code | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `auth_required` | Not authenticated (HTTP 401) | Authenticate, then retry once |
| `permission_denied` | Authenticated but not allowed (HTTP 403) | Don't retry; report the missing permission |
| `insufficient_scope` | Token lacks the scopes this command needs | Don't retry; re-create the token with the `missing_scopes` in the envelope, or follow `suggestions` to an alternative the token can read |
| `not_found` | Resource does not exist (HTTP 404) | Verify the ID with `dtctl get <resource>` |
| `conflict` | Concurrent or duplicate change (HTTP 409) | Re-read the resource, re-apply on top |
| `bad_request` | The API rejected the request shape (HTTP 400) | Fix the payload; don't retry unchanged |
| `rate_limited` | Too many requests (HTTP 429) | Back off, then retry |
| `server_error` | Dynatrace-side failure (HTTP 5xx) | Retry with backoff; escalate if persistent |
| `timeout` | The operation timed out client-side | Narrow the request (timeframe, limit) and retry |
| `query_failed` | The query ended in state `FAILED` | Don't retry unchanged; fix the query |
| `query_cancelled` | The query was cancelled on the server | Retry if the cancellation was not intended |
| `result_expired` | The query result expired, was consumed, or was cancelled before it was fetched (HTTP 410) | Run the same query again |
| `unknown_query_state` | The query reported a state this dtctl does not know, or never left it before the poll deadline | Upgrade dtctl; re-run if the query was simply slow |
| `function_error` | The code you submitted to `exec function` failed | Fix the code; don't retry unchanged |
| `safety_blocked` | The context's [safety level](CONFIGURATION.md#safety-levels) forbids this operation | Don't retry; ask a human to widen the level |
| `profile_blocked` | The active [command profile](CONFIGURATION.md#command-profiles) doesn't expose this command | Re-read `dtctl commands` and pick a supported path |
| `stability_blocked` | The command or a flag you used offers a weaker contract than the context's [stability floor](STABILITY.md#choosing-what-this-environment-accepts) accepts | Don't retry; use a `stable` alternative, or ask a human to admit this entry |
| `deprecated_surface` | The command or flag is deprecated and this context refuses deprecated surface ([`DTCTL_NO_DEPRECATED`](STABILITY.md#finding-out-early-what-a-removal-will-break)) | Don't retry; migrate to the replacement named in `suggestions` |
| `development_disabled` | A `development`-tier feature that nobody enabled here | Don't retry; it needs `dtctl config set development.<feature> on` |
| `unsupported_in_service` | Host-only command, unavailable in server mode | Don't retry; the suggestion says why |
| `capability_disabled` | A host ability (plugin, alias, hook, editor, browser) isn't granted | Don't retry; use an in-process alternative |
| `hook_rejected` | A pre-apply hook rejected the resource | Fix the resource, or apply with `--no-hooks` |
| `validation_error` | Local input validation failed | Fix the file or flags |
| `unknown_command` | Unknown command, resource type or flag | Follow the suggestion (a runnable command where dtctl can name one); re-read `dtctl commands` |
| `context_error` | No active context, or the named context is missing | Select a context (`dtctl ctx <name>`) |
| `config_error` | The dtctl config could not be read or is invalid | Report it; needs human repair |
| `spill_file_not_found` | The spilled result file is gone | `dtctl inspect --list`, or re-run the query |
| `spill_file_unreadable` | The spill file exists but cannot be parsed | Re-run the query |
| `spill_file_wrong_context` | The spill file belongs to another context or tenant | Switch context, or re-query here |
| `inspect_unknown_field` | `--fields` named a column the file doesn't have | Use `dtctl inspect <path> --schema` |
| `inspect_bad_flags` | Incompatible `dtctl inspect` flags | Pick one row-access primitive per call |
| `api_index_unavailable` | The environment publishes no machine-readable API index | Stop probing for specifications; use the native commands |
| `api_spec_unavailable` | A listed API's specification could not be read | Don't retry; `dtctl get apis` still names the API |
| `error` | Unclassified failure | Read `message`; treat as non-retryable |

`dtctl query` additionally passes the DQL API's own error type through as the code
(lowercased), e.g. `unknown_data_object`. **Treat an unrecognised code as
`error`** -- read `message` and `suggestions` instead of branching on it.

The exception is a table the token cannot read: Grail's `NOT_AUTHORIZED_FOR_TABLE`
is reported as `insufficient_scope` (exit code 5), with `missing_scopes` naming
the storage scope when the error identifies the table. When the token's scopes
are introspectable (OAuth), `dtctl query` also checks the query *before* sending
it: a query that provably needs a storage scope the token lacks -- `fetch logs`
needs `storage:logs:read`, `smartscapeNodes`/`getNodeName()` need
`storage:smartscape:read` -- fails fast with the same code, without a request.
The check only blocks what it is certain of; with a platform or API token it
never blocks, and the query runs as usual.

When the DQL API reports where in the query the error is, the envelope also
carries `position` (1-based `line` and `column`, counted in characters, plus
`end_line`/`end_column` with the end inclusive) and `snippet` (the offending
line with a caret line under it). For a known authoring trap, the first
suggestion is the corrected query, ready to run:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "parse_error",
    "message": "query failed (PARSE_ERROR): `by` isn't allowed here. ...",
    "status_code": 400,
    "position": {"line": 1, "column": 32, "end_line": 1, "end_column": 33},
    "snippet": "fetch logs | summarize count() by service.name\n                               ^^",
    "suggestions": [
      "group with the by: parameter, by:{field, …}, not a trailing by keyword: dtctl query 'fetch logs | summarize count(), by:{service.name}'"
    ]
  }
}
```

The traps with a rewrite: `=` instead of `==` in `filter`/`filterOut`; a
trailing `by field` instead of `by:{field}`; `name: aggregation(…)` instead of
`name = aggregation(…)`; `array.contains(arr, v)` instead of `in(v, arr)`; a
duration as `rollup:` instead of `interval:` on `timeseries`; a positional
condition on `timeseries` instead of `filter:`; and `fetch dt.entity.service` /
`dt.entity.host` where those tables are not data objects, instead of
`smartscapeNodes`. A non-metric aggregation on `timeseries` (e.g. `last()`) gets
advice rather than a rewrite, because the fix depends on whether the field is a
metric. A hint is only given when the pattern clearly matches; the suggested
command carries only the query, so re-add any flags you used.

### Exit codes

The process exit code is the same verdict at lower resolution, for shell callers
that do not parse the envelope:

| Exit | Meaning | Codes that produce it |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | Success | -- |
| `1` | General failure | every code not listed below |
| `2` | Usage error | `unknown_command`, `profile_blocked`, `stability_blocked`, `deprecated_surface`, `development_disabled`, `unsupported_in_service`, and `validation_error` for an empty flag value |
| `3` | Not authenticated (HTTP 401) | `auth_required` |
| `4` | Resource does not exist (HTTP 404) | `not_found` |
| `5` | Not allowed (HTTP 403) | `permission_denied`, `insufficient_scope` |

Branch on `code` wherever you can. An exit code cannot tell `safety_blocked`
apart from a network failure, and a new code arrives without a new exit code.

### Query results: the `result.kind` discriminator

In agent mode, `dtctl query` results are self-describing: the `result` payload
carries a `kind` field so a consumer always branches on one discriminator,
regardless of how big the result was. There are three kinds:

| `result.kind` | When | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| `records` | small result, returned inline | the rows under `result.records` |
| `result-file` | large result spilled to a file (see [Result Spill](CONFIGURATION.md#result-spill)) | a manifest: `path`, `format`, `rows`, `bytes`, column stats, `sample_rows` |
| `summary-only` | large result but the rows could not be written to disk | the same manifest **minus `path`** |

On a `result-file` result the rows are on disk, so read them with `dtctl inspect
<path>` (see [COMMANDS.md](COMMANDS.md)) -- `--head`/`--tail`/`--page`/
`--fields` for bounded row access, `--jq '<program>'` to keep only the matching
rows (a streaming filter over the whole file; a large match set re-spills via the
same `--spill*` guard), `--schema`/`--stats` to re-derive the profile, `--list`
to recover a path that has aged out of context -- instead of re-querying Grail.
On a `summary-only` result the rows are not on disk, so `context.suggestions`
carries the right next step for *why* the spill degraded: a read-only filesystem
steers you to re-query with `--spill=never` and a bound (`| fields …` /
`| limit N`, or `--max-result-records N`) so the inline result stays small, while
a one-off write failure suggests retrying with an explicit `--spill-to <path>`.

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "envelope_version": 1,
  "result": {
    "kind": "result-file",
    "path": "~/Library/Caches/dtctl/results/prod/q-7f3a9c.jsonl",
    "format": "jsonl",
    "rows": 84213,
    "columns": [ { "name": "status", "type": "long", "nulls": 0, "min": 500, "max": 599 } ],
    "sample_rows": [ /* first few rows */ ]
  },
  "context": {
    "verb": "query", "resource": "logs", "total": 84213,
    "decided": "spilled", "threshold_bytes": 51200, "measured_bytes": 16804000
  }
}
```

The envelope carries `envelope_version` for forward compatibility. **A consumer
MUST treat an unrecognised `result.kind` as opaque** -- don't parse `result`, fall
back to the human-readable `context` (which always carries `decided`, `total`,
`warnings`, and `suggestions`). When Grail sampled the result, the per-column
stats move into a `sample_stats` block (each column tagged `basis: "sample"`) so
sample-based figures can't be misread as population truth.

> The inline `kind: "records"` envelope is emitted on the spill-aware path
> whenever agent mode emits JSON -- including under `--spill=never`, which forces
> every row inline regardless of size but still as a `kind: "records"` envelope
> (never a human table). The agent-mode default `-o auto` also keeps this
> envelope (see below). Explicit non-JSON output (`-o toon/csv/yaml`) and `--jq`
> transforms keep their requested shape and fall through to the plain
> `{ "records": …, "metadata": … }` output.

> Timeseries results are the most token-expensive shape: every series is a
> full-precision array. `--series=summary` replaces each with its statistics and
> a sparkline (typically ~9x fewer tokens), `--series=downsample:N` keeps at
> most N extreme-preserving points, and `--precision 3` rounds away the noise
> digits. All three are opt-in (experimental); see
> [Output Formats](OUTPUT_FORMATS.md#compact-timeseries---series---precision).

### Choosing the encoding with `-o auto`

No single encoding is the cheapest for every result: CSV wins on flat rows,
while nested documents come out smaller as YAML or JSON than as TOON. `-o auto`
lets dtctl choose per result (the rules are listed in
[OUTPUT_FORMATS.md](OUTPUT_FORMATS.md#auto--o-auto) and are experimental).

**`dtctl query` uses `-o auto` by default in agent mode** when no `-o` is given.
Pass `-o json` to get the previous native-JSON rows back; any other explicit
`-o` also wins over the default. Other commands keep native JSON unless you pass
`-o auto` yourself. When the default returns CSV or YAML, `context.suggestions`
carries one entry naming the `-o json` opt-out; when it returns native JSON
(empty or scalar results), nothing is added.

The envelope names the choice in `context.format`, so branch on it before parsing:

| `context.format` | `result` (or `result.records` for `dtctl query`) |
|---|---|
| `csv` | a CSV string with a header row |
| `yaml` | a YAML string |
| `json` | a native JSON value (used for empty and scalar results) |

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "envelope_version": 1,
  "result": { "kind": "records", "encoding": "csv", "records": "count(),loglevel\n1204,ERROR\n88311,INFO\n" },
  "context": { "verb": "query", "resource": "logs", "total": 2, "format": "csv", "decided": "inline" }
}
```

For `dtctl query`, `-o auto` keeps the `kind: "records"` envelope below the
spill threshold (unlike an explicit `-o csv`/`-o yaml`, which print raw bytes)
and the threshold is measured in the chosen encoding. A spilled result is a
`result-file` manifest as usual and carries no `context.format`.

### Empty query results: `context.empty_reason`

A misspelled field name or metric key makes DQL succeed with zero rows. On an
empty result (no rows, or the single all-zero row of a `summarize count()`),
dtctl runs one small, bounded probe before it suggests widening the time window:

| Query shape | Probe | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| `fetch <object> \| filter …` / `summarize … by:` | the query's own `fetch` stage with `\| limit 100`, and the field names in its `filter`/`filterOut` stages and `by:` clause compared against the sampled records | `field_not_in_sample` |
| `timeseries …` | the metric keys that reported series in the query window (at most its last 2h), listed with the `metrics` command | `metric_not_in_window` |

The probes are capped (1 GB scan, 10 s read time, bounded result size), run only
on an empty result that no scan, time, result or consumption limit cut short,
and never fail the query. If a probe errors, comes back
partial, or finds an empty sample, the envelope keeps the widen-the-window advice
and has no `empty_reason`.

`context.empty_reason` is set only when a missing name has a close match that
*was* observed, which is what a typo looks like. That advice replaces the
widen-the-window suggestion, because a wider window cannot fix a misspelled
name:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "result": { "kind": "records", "records": null },
  "context": {
    "total": 0,
    "empty_reason": {
      "code": "field_not_in_sample",
      "field": "servce.name",
      "data_object": "logs",
      "did_you_mean": ["service.name"],
      "sample_size": 100,
      "evidence": "`servce.name` is absent from all 100 sampled `logs` records (the query's fetch stage with `| limit 100`); the near match is present in the sample"
    },
    "suggestions": ["# `servce.name` did not occur in any of the 100 sampled `logs` records, but `service.name` did — likely a typo in the field name; …"]
  }
}
```

A finding is an observation about a sample or a window, not a catalog fact.
`evidence` names that basis. A field can be rare enough to be missing from a
100-record sample. A missing name with no close match therefore only adds a
hedged note to `suggestions`, and the widen-the-window advice stays.

### Query metadata

In agent mode `dtctl query` adds the Grail query metadata as a top-level
`metadata` key next to `result` and `context`. Agent mode defaults to
`--metadata=minimal`, which keeps only what an agent acts on. The full block
repeats the query text as `query` and `canonicalQuery` and adds `locale`,
`timezone`, `dqlVersion` and `queryId`, and on small results it can be larger
than the rows. Pass `-M=all` (or bare `-M`) to get it back exactly as before.
Outside agent mode metadata stays off unless `-M` is given.

The minimal set:

| Field | Included |
|---|---|
| `executionTimeMilliseconds` | always |
| `scannedBytes`, `scannedDataPoints` | when non-zero |
| `sampled` | only when `true` (the result is approximate) |
| `analysisTimeframe` | only when the query named no window, so the server picked the default one |
| `contributions` | when requested with `--include-contributions` |

It also drops the spill measurement details (`threshold_bytes`, `measured_bytes`,
`measured_encoding`) from `context` on an inline result; they stay on a spilled or
summary-only result, where they explain the decision, and come back with `-v`.
`context.decided` is always present. When the default dropped something,
`context.suggestions` carries one line naming `-M=all`; an explicit
`-M=minimal` does not. Add field names to opt back into more,
e.g. `--metadata=minimal,queryId`; `--metadata=` (empty) turns metadata off.

```bash
dtctl query 'fetch logs | summarize c=count(), by:{loglevel}' -A
```

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "envelope_version": 1,
  "result": { "kind": "records", "records": [ { "c": "26", "loglevel": "ERROR" } ] },
  "context": {
    "verb": "query", "resource": "logs", "total": 1, "decided": "inline",
    "suggestions": [ "# metadata trimmed by default; -M=all for the full block" ]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "executionTimeMilliseconds": 132,
    "scannedBytes": 623373940,
    "analysisTimeframe": { "start": "2026-01-02T01:00:00Z", "end": "2026-01-02T03:00:00Z" }
  }
}
```

### Compacted rows: `constant`

Agent mode compacts query rows by default (`--compact`, experimental): null
values are omitted, and every column that holds the same value in every row is
printed once, in a `constant` map that comes **before** `records`. Log and
span rows are dominated by resource attributes shared across the whole result,
so this is usually the larger part of the payload. Shown here with `-o json`:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "envelope_version": 1,
  "result": {
    "kind": "records",
    "constant": { "k8s.cluster.name": "prod-eu", "service.name": "payment" },
    "records": [ { "timestamp": "…", "span.name": "POST /pay", "duration": "812000" } ]
  }
}
```

**Reading it:** a row is `constant` merged with its entry in `records`; a key
absent from both is null. `result.kind` stays `records`, `constant` is omitted
when nothing is shared, and `context.total` still counts the rows.

- It applies to the JSON envelope and to `-o toon`, where `constant` stays a
  JSON map next to the encoded `records` string. TOON keeps a null in a column
  that has values in other rows, so the rows still encode as one table; only
  all-null columns are dropped there. `-o csv` and `--jq` get the
  full rows (a `--jq` program always sees uncompacted records).
- Under `-o auto`, which is also the agent-mode default for `query`, both
  defaults apply together: the encoding is chosen from the compacted rows
  (constant and all-null columns already removed), and `constant` stays a JSON map next to
  the encoded `records` whichever encoding was picked. When auto picks `csv`,
  partial nulls stay as empty cells so the rows remain one table; when it picks
  `yaml`, nulls are dropped as in JSON.
- `constant` needs at least two rows; a single row only loses its nulls.
- The spill decision measures the compacted payload, since that is what reaches
  the agent.
- On a `result-file` / `summary-only` manifest the same columns collapse out of
  the per-column profile: single-value columns go into `constant`, all-null
  columns are listed by name in `null_columns`, and `sample_rows` drop both.
  The spilled file and its sidecar manifest keep every row and column in full.
- When compaction changed the result, `context.suggestions` says so once and
  names the opt-out; when there was nothing to compact, it adds nothing.
- **Opt out with `--compact=false`**, which restores the full rows (and the
  full per-column profile in a manifest) exactly. Outside agent mode,
  `--compact` opts in for plain `-o json`/`yaml`/`toon`.

## Auto-Detection

dtctl automatically enables agent mode when it detects it is running inside a known AI agent environment. Detection is based on the presence of specific environment variables:

| Environment Variable | Agent |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDECODE` | Claude Code |
| `OPENCODE` | OpenCode |
| `GITHUB_COPILOT` | GitHub Copilot |
| `CURSOR_AGENT` | Cursor |
| `KIRO` | Kiro |
| `JUNIE` | Junie |
| `OPENCLAW` | OpenClaw |
| `CODEIUM_AGENT` | Codeium / Windsurf |
| `TABNINE_AGENT` | Tabnine |
| `AMAZON_Q` | Amazon Q |

When auto-detected, agent mode is enabled without requiring the `--agent` flag.

### Opting out

To disable auto-detection and get normal human-readable output:

```bash
dtctl get workflows --no-agent
```

## Behavior

Agent mode implies `--plain`:

- No ANSI colors in output
- No interactive prompts (e.g. name disambiguation)
- No progress spinners or animations

This ensures output is always machine-parseable.

A few consequences worth knowing when you parse the output:

- **Command-line mistakes are enveloped too.** An unknown command, resource type
  or flag produces `{"ok": false, "error": {"code": "unknown_command", ...}}` on
  stdout and exits with the usage code (2) -- also when agent mode was
  auto-detected rather than requested with `-A`. Where dtctl can name the command
  you most likely meant, `suggestions` carries it as a line that runs as-is: a
  `get` with the misspelled resource `dashbords` suggests `dtctl get dashboards`.
- **Query notifications live in the envelope, not on stderr.** Result-limit,
  scan-limit and timeout notices are in `context.warnings`, with the advice in
  `context.suggestions`. dtctl writes them to stderr only when there is no
  envelope to carry them (`-o csv`, `-o yaml`, charts). When a result limit cuts
  a `summarize ..., by:{...}` that has no `sort`, the suggestions say so: the
  groups kept are arbitrary, so rank before the cut (`| sort <agg> desc | limit N`).

## Command Catalog

AI agents can bootstrap their knowledge of dtctl using the built-in command catalog:

```bash
# Minimal overview -- verbs, resources, and subcommands only (defaults to TOON)
dtctl commands

# Brief catalog -- adds mutating status, access levels, flag types, and scopes
dtctl commands --brief -o json

# Full catalog -- detailed command descriptions, flag defaults, and global flags
dtctl commands --full -o json

# Human-readable how-to guide in Markdown
dtctl commands howto
```

The bare `dtctl commands` overview is ideal for including in an agent's system prompt or initial context, giving it a complete map of available operations without consuming excessive tokens; step up to `--brief` or `--full` when more detail is needed.

## Environment Inventory

`dtctl inventory` probes the current context's environment and reports what data
actually exists there. Where `dtctl commands` (above) answers *"what can I
run?"*, `dtctl inventory` answers *"what is there to query?"* -- which makes it
the natural first call before exploratory DQL, for humans and AI agents alike.

Discovery is **read-only and budgeted**: it runs a small battery of DQL queries (4 by default) and stops with a partial inventory rather than overrunning its budget. Nothing is persisted.

```bash
# The environment inventory for the current context
dtctl inventory

# Structured output (full lists, no compaction)
dtctl inventory -o json
dtctl inventory -o yaml
```

### What it reports

- **Data objects** -- which Grail catalog objects are fetchable, and which are query-only (`metrics`, `smartscape.*`) so you aren't baited into `fetch` calls that cannot work. The hundreds of legacy `dt.entity.*` lookback views are collapsed to an `entityViews` count.
- **Buckets** and **filter segments** -- segments can be applied to queries with `-S <name>`.
- **Live entity-type census** -- entity type → count via `smartscapeNodes`, the current-state topology (not the `dt.entity.*` lookback views, which diverge from it).
- **Capabilities** -- spans, logs, RUM, k8s, cloud integrations, metric families, and anything you define yourself: each reported as **present**, **absent**, or **unknown**.

Example (synthetic):

```
Context:      example
Generated:    2026-01-02T03:04:05Z
Capabilities: hosts, logs, spans
Absent (what was checked)
  rum — user.events is in the catalog, but all its buckets are empty (0 records within retention)
Unknown (no verdict — not evidence of absence)
  genai — probe failed: scan limit exceeded
Entities:     K8S_POD:200 SERVICE:40 HOST:12
Data objects: logs, spans (+2 dt.entity.* lookback views)
Query-only:   metrics (no fetch — see notes)
Buckets:      default_logs, default_spans
Segments (apply with -S <name>)
  prod — production workloads
```

### Verdicts carry evidence

Every **absent** capability cites exactly what was checked (`no K8S_* entities in the live census`, `user.events is in the catalog, but all its buckets are empty`), so a negative finding is citable without anyone re-deriving it with fresh probes.

A capability whose check could not run -- a failed probe, an exhausted budget, an unavailable or truncated fact source -- is reported as **unknown** with the reason, never as absent. Unknown must not be read as absent: the capability may still exist.

Stream capabilities get liveness checking for free: bucket statistics (already fetched for the bucket list) reveal when a catalog object holds zero records within retention, so a tenant that never ingested RUM reports `rum` as absent even though `user.events` sits in its catalog.

### Customizing the capability set

dtctl ships a built-in, structural-only capability set (topology, signal streams, metric families). Your own definitions merge over it:

```bash
# Merge org-specific definitions over the built-in set (repeatable, later files win)
dtctl inventory --definitions ./our-capabilities.yaml

# Only your definitions, without the built-in set
dtctl inventory --definitions ./our-capabilities.yaml --no-builtin-definitions
```

Each capability is defined by *how* it is discovered -- exactly one of four fixed shapes, deliberately not an expression language:

| Shape | Present when | Evidence strength | Extra cost |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|------------|
| `dataObject` | the object is in the catalog and its buckets hold data | strong | none |
| `entityTypes` (globs) | a matching type has live entities in the census | strong | none |
| `metricKey` (glob) | a matching key is in the live metric catalog | strong | none (shared query) |
| `probe` + `window` | the DQL probe returns at least one row | **weak negative** | 1 query per run |

```yaml
apiVersion: dtctl.dev/v1alpha1
kind: InventoryDefinitions
capabilities:
  # Managed postgres appears under hyperscaler entity types, not the generic one
  postgres:
    entityTypes: [DB_INSTANCE_POSTGRES, "*_DBFORPOSTGRESQL_*"]

  # Only visible in span attributes: probe with a capped, sampled scan
  genai:
    probe: 'fetch spans, from:now()-24h, samplingRatio:100 | filter isNotNull(gen_ai.system) | limit 1'
    window: 24h

  # Remove a built-in capability from the merged set
  aws-cloudwatch: null
```

Globs are case-sensitive: Smartscape entity types are UPPERCASE (`K8S_*`, `AZURE_*`), so a lowercase pattern silently never matches. Probe shapes must declare `window` -- the evidence window the probe covers -- because their negatives are weak: absence of events in a window is not absence of the capability.

See [docs/dev/examples/inventory-definitions.example.yaml](dev/examples/inventory-definitions.example.yaml) for the annotated format.

### Budgets and cost

Discovery is bounded on three axes; it stops with a partial inventory (and says so) rather than overrunning:

```bash
dtctl inventory --budget-queries 100     # max queries (default 100)
dtctl inventory --budget-seconds 300     # max cumulative query seconds (default 300)
dtctl inventory --scan-limit-gbytes 25   # scan cap applied to every probe (default 25)
```

The default battery is 4 queries: data-object catalog, buckets, entity census, and the metric catalog (only when a `metricKey` definition needs it, and filtered to the globs those definitions actually use -- a `metricKey` pattern with `?` or `[a-z]` character classes cannot be pushed into the query, so it falls back to reading the whole catalog). Probe-shaped definitions cost one query each. A consumption receipt (`discovery: {queries, seconds}`) is attached to every inventory.

`--budget-seconds` is a hard bound, not a running tally: a query is issued with the budget still unspent as its deadline, so a single slow query is cut off at the budget instead of overrunning it. Whatever it would have answered degrades to `unknown` with its evidence, exactly like any other skipped check. Callers running `inventory` under an outer timeout should still leave headroom -- client setup and the segment fetch happen before the first query and are not part of the query budget.

### For AI agents

In agent mode (auto-detected, see [Auto-Detection](#auto-detection) above), the inventory arrives in the structured JSON envelope with suggestions attached -- sample a listed data object, cite absence evidence instead of re-probing. Absent and unknown capabilities are structured `{name, evidence}` pairs:

```json
"absent": [
  {"name": "rum", "evidence": "user.events is in the catalog, but all its buckets are empty (0 records within retention)"}
]
```

This is about the data in the environment, not the resources you manage -- for dashboards, workflows, SLOs, and the rest, use `dtctl get <resource>`.

## Tips and Tricks

### Keep list output small

In agent mode a `get` list returns a page of at most **50** items by
default. When the page cuts the list, `context.total` holds the full count,
`context.has_more` is `true`, and a suggestion names the opt-out: `--limit 0`
returns every item, a larger `--limit` returns more. Trim the items themselves
with `--fields` *(experimental)*:

```bash
dtctl get dashboards -A --fields id,name,owner,modificationInfo.lastModifiedTime
dtctl get dashboards -A --limit 0     # every dashboard
```

With `-o toon`, the projected fields are flattened into columns so the result stays a single TOON table. See
[Output Formats](OUTPUT_FORMATS.md#trimming-lists---limit---fields).

### Name resolution

When agent mode is active, interactive name disambiguation is disabled. Use exact IDs instead of display names to avoid ambiguity:

```bash
# Prefer IDs in agent mode
dtctl describe workflow wf-abc123

# Names may fail if multiple resources share the same name
dtctl describe workflow "Daily Health Check"
```

All `describe` subcommands support agent mode, returning the full resource object in the JSON envelope:

```bash
dtctl describe workflow wf-abc123 --agent
dtctl describe slo my-slo -A
dtctl describe dashboard my-dash -o json -A
```

### Dry-run

Use `--dry-run` to preview mutating operations without making changes:

```bash
dtctl apply -f workflow.yaml --dry-run
```

### Diff

Use `--show-diff` to see what would change when updating an existing resource:

```bash
dtctl apply -f workflow.yaml --show-diff
```

### Verbose output

Use `-v` or `--verbose` for additional debugging information:

```bash
dtctl get workflows -v --agent
```

### Environment variables

Point dtctl at a prepared config and supply the token out of band, so an agent
never runs an interactive login:

```bash
export DTCTL_CONFIG="$PWD/.dtctl.yaml"   # explicit config file (also trusts its hooks)
export DTCTL_CONTEXT="prod"              # pick a context for this invocation
export DTCTL_TOKEN="dt0s16.XXXXXXXX.YYYYYYYY"
dtctl get workflows --agent
```

The environment URL comes from the context, not from the environment. There is
no `DTCTL_ENVIRONMENT`; create the context once with `dtctl config set-context`
(see [Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md)) and select it with `DTCTL_CONTEXT`.

### Pipeline commands

Chain dtctl commands with standard Unix tools:

```bash
# Get all workflow IDs, then describe each one
dtctl get workflows -o json --agent | jq -r '.result[].id' | xargs -I{} dtctl describe workflow {} --agent

# Export query results for processing
dtctl query 'fetch logs | filter status == "ERROR" | limit 10' -o json --agent | jq '.result'
```

## Implementation notes (for contributors)

- Agent envelope: `pkg/output/agent.go` (`AgentPrinter`, `Response`, `PrintError`)
- Per-command context enrichment: the `enrichAgent()` helper in `cmd/root.go`
- Environment auto-detection: `sdk/agentmode/`, wired into `pkg/aidetect/detect.go`
- Environment inventory discovery: `sdk/inventory/`

When adding support for a new AI agent environment variable, update **all** of:
code (`pkg/aidetect/detect.go`, `pkg/skills/installer.go`, `cmd/skills.go`),
tests (`pkg/aidetect/detect_test.go`, `pkg/skills/installer_test.go`,
`cmd/skills_test.go`), and docs (`README.md`, this file). See `AGENTS.md` in the
repo root for the full contributor checklist.
