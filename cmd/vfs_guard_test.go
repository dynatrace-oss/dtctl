// hostFileAccessRoots are the trees the guard scans, relative to this package's
// directory. cmd/ holds the flag plumbing and pkg/ the code it delegates to —
// a user-named path is just as request-bound one call deeper, which is exactly
// how `dtctl diff -f a.yaml -f b.yaml` (pkg/diff) and `dtctl inspect <file>`
// (pkg/inspect) escaped the seam while a cmd/-only scan stayed green.
//
// sdk/ is deliberately out of scope: it is a separate module with no notion of
// a dtctl invocation, and sdk/session owns the config file and credential
// stores by contract (see docs/dev/CONFIG_CONTRACT.md).

// filesystem directly, keyed by slash-separated path from the repository root,

// write user-supplied paths through pkg/vfs.
//
// The distinction is *whose* file it is:
//
//   - a path the user named on the command line (-f, --file, --data-file, a
//     query file, a file to diff) is request state — under an embedded
//     invocation it exists only in the request's virtual filesystem, so it must
//     go through vfs
//   - a path dtctl chose itself (an editor round-trip temp file, the config
//     file, a spill buffer) is host state and belongs on the host disk
//
// Host state is only defensible when an embedded invocation cannot reach it, so
// each entry below names what keeps it unreachable: a blocked command, an
// ungranted capability, or both.
