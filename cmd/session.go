// callers. When set on RunOptions, the invocation runs against exactly this
// environment and token: the host's config file, contexts, keyring, and
// credential env vars are all out of the picture, which is what a multi-tenant
// service needs — every request brings its own tenant
// (docs/dev/SERVICE_ENGINE_DESIGN.md).
//
// A session replaces credential *resolution*, not command *policy*: blocking
// commands that make no sense service-side (config, ctx, login) is the
// engine's job, on top of this seam.

// variable the host set for its own CLI use would silently widen or narrow
// every tenant's surface, and DTCTL_DEVELOPMENT could register unfinished
// commands into a request that never asked for them. The floor and its
// exceptions are per-request fields on Session instead; there is deliberately
// no request field for development features — a service does not expose
// surface that carries no contract at all.
