// pluginCmd groups plugin management. dtctl follows the kubectl exec
// convention: any executable named dtctl-<name> on PATH runs as
// `dtctl <name>`. There is deliberately no installer and no registry — see
// docs/dev/PLUGIN_CONVENTIONS.md for the author-facing contract.
var pluginCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "plugin",
	Short: "Manage dtctl plugins (executables named dtctl-* on PATH)",
	Long: `dtctl supports kubectl-style exec plugins: any executable on PATH named
dtctl-<name> extends dtctl with the 'dtctl <name>' command. Multi-word
commands map to dash-joined names ('dtctl foo bar' runs dtctl-foo-bar,
falling back to dtctl-foo with 'bar' as an argument).

Built-in commands always win: a plugin can never shadow or override a
built-in dtctl command.

Plugins resolve configuration and credentials themselves — dtctl passes
context via environment variables (DTCTL_CONTEXT, DTCTL_CONFIG, DTCTL_AGENT,
DTCTL_PLAIN, DTCTL_CALLER_VERSION), never tokens or other secrets.

See docs/dev/PLUGIN_CONVENTIONS.md for the plugin author guide.`,
