## How to Contribute

### Ways to Contribute

- **Report bugs** - Help us identify and fix issues
- **Suggest features** - Share ideas for improvements
- **Write documentation** - Improve guides, examples, and API docs
- **Submit code** - Fix bugs or implement new features
- **Review pull requests** - Help review and test contributions

### Finding Issues to Work On

- Check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/issues)
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
- Ask in discussions if you're unsure where to start

## Pull Request Process

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues and PRs** to avoid duplicate work
2. **Create an issue** to discuss major changes before implementing
3. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch

### Creating a Pull Request

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**:
   - Write clear, focused commits
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed
   - Follow coding standards (see below)

3. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   make test

   # Run linters
   make lint

   # Check test coverage
   make coverage
   ```

4. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Create a pull request**:
   - Use a clear, descriptive title
   - Reference any related issues
   - Describe what changed and why
   - Include examples if applicable

### PR Requirements

Your pull request must:

- ✅ Pass all CI checks (tests, linting, security scans)
- ✅ Maintain or improve test coverage (minimum 70%)
- ✅ Include tests for new functionality
- ✅ Update documentation if behavior changes
- ✅ Follow the project's coding standards
- ✅ Have clear commit messages
- ✅ Be up-to-date with the main branch

### Review Process

1. Maintainers will review your PR within 5 business days
2. Address any feedback or requested changes
3. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR
4. Your contribution will be included in the next release

## Coding Standards

### Go Style Guide

Follow the official [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments) and [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html).

### Specific Guidelines

**File Organization**:
- Keep files under 500 lines
- One package per directory
- Group related functionality together

**Naming**:
- Use descriptive names (avoid abbreviations except for common ones)
- Follow Go conventions: `camelCase` for unexported, `PascalCase` for exported
- Interfaces: use `-er` suffix (e.g., `Handler`, `Executor`)

**Error Handling**:
- Always check errors
- Wrap errors with context using `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`
- Return errors rather than logging and continuing

**Comments**:
- Add package-level comments for all packages
- Document all exported functions, types, and constants
- Use `//` for comments, not `/* */`
- Explain "why" not "what" for complex logic

**Code Organization**:
```go
package example

// Imports (standard library first, then third-party, then internal)
import (
    "context"
    "fmt"

    "github.com/spf13/cobra"

    "github.com/dynatrace/dtctl/pkg/client"
)

// Constants
const defaultTimeout = 30 * time.Second

// Variables
var ErrNotFound = errors.New("resource not found")

// Types
type Handler struct { ... }

// Functions
func NewHandler() *Handler { ... }
```

### Formatting

- Use `gofmt` to format code (enforced in CI)
- Use `goimports` to organize imports
- Maximum line length: 120 characters

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage

- **Minimum**: 70% overall coverage
- **New code**: 80% coverage for new packages
- **Critical packages**: 90% coverage for `pkg/client`, `pkg/config`

### Writing Tests

**Test file naming**: `*_test.go` (e.g., `client_test.go`)

**Test function naming**: `TestFunctionName_Scenario` (e.g., `TestNewClient_InvalidURL`)

**Test structure** (use table-driven tests):
```go
func TestHandler_Get(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        id      string
        want    *Resource
        wantErr bool
    }{
        {
            name:    "valid resource",
            id:      "123",
            want:    &Resource{ID: "123"},
            wantErr: false,
        },
        {
            name:    "not found",
            id:      "invalid",
            want:    nil,
            wantErr: true,
        },
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // Test implementation
        })
    }
}
```

### Test Types

- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions in isolation
- **Integration tests**: Test component interactions (use `httptest` for API mocking)
- **E2E tests**: Test complete workflows (in `test/e2e/`)

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage
make coverage

# Run specific package tests
go test ./pkg/client/...

# Run specific test
go test -run TestClientNew ./pkg/client/

# Run tests with race detection
go test -race ./...
```

## Commit Messages

### Format

```
<type>: <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `refactor`: Code refactoring (no functional changes)
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (dependencies, tooling)
- `ci`: CI/CD changes

### Examples

```
feat: add support for OpenPipeline resources

Implement get, create, update, and delete operations for OpenPipeline
configurations. Includes CLI commands and resource handler.

Closes #123
```

```
fix: handle pagination correctly in document listing

Previously, only the first page of results was returned when listing
documents. Now correctly follows pagination tokens to fetch all results.

Fixes #456
```

### Guidelines

- Use imperative mood ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Keep subject line under 50 characters
- Capitalize subject line
- No period at the end of subject line
- Separate subject from body with blank line
- Wrap body at 72 characters
- Explain what and why, not how

## Reporting Bugs

### Before Reporting

- Check if the bug has already been reported
- Verify it's reproducible on the latest version
- Gather relevant information (version, OS, configuration)

### Bug Report Template

When reporting a bug, include:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the issue
2. **Steps to Reproduce**:
   ```
   1. Run `dtctl get workflows`
   2. Observe error message
   ```
3. **Expected Behavior**: What you expected to happen
4. **Actual Behavior**: What actually happened
5. **Environment**:
   - dtctl version (`dtctl version`)
   - OS and version
   - Go version (if building from source)
6. **Additional Context**: Logs, screenshots, or other relevant information

## Suggesting Features

### Feature Request Template

When suggesting a feature, include:

1. **Problem Statement**: What problem does this solve?
2. **Proposed Solution**: How should it work?
3. **Alternatives Considered**: Other approaches you considered
4. **Use Cases**: Real-world scenarios where this would be useful
5. **Implementation Ideas**: Technical approach (optional)

## Development Workflow

### Makefile Targets

```bash
# Build the binary
make build

# Run tests
make test

# Run linters
make lint

# Generate coverage report
make coverage

# Run security scans
make security-scan

# Build for all platforms
make build-all

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

### CI Pipeline

All pull requests must pass:

1. **Tests**: All tests must pass on Linux, macOS, and Windows
2. **Linting**: `golangci-lint` must pass with zero errors
3. **Security**: `govulncheck` must find no vulnerabilities
4. **Coverage**: Overall coverage must be ≥70%
