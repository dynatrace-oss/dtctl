package engine

// unsupportedCommands are the top-level dtctl commands the engine removes from
// the surface: they manage host-local state (config file, keyring, shell,
// installed tools) that does not exist for a service request, or would nest
// the service in itself. Everything else — the entire resource surface (get,
// describe, create, apply, delete, query, exec, ...) — runs as-is.
//
// A blocked command is hidden from `dtctl commands` and help, and invoking it
// returns the stable agent-mode error code "unsupported_in_service" with the
// reason below (see cmd.UnsupportedCommandError).
//
// Note the axis: this list is about the *environment* (service vs. host CLI).
// What a request may do to its tenant is governed separately by the
// per-request safety level, and its visible command set optionally by a
// per-request profile.

	// request never spills (the HostDiskSpill capability is not granted, so

	// server's disk rather than in the request — host state on both counts.
