// forbiddenError builds the 403 error for a Resource Store file operation.
//
// A Grail file operation passes two independent gates that share a name: the
// OAuth scope in the token (e.g. storage:files:delete) and the IAM policy
// permission of the same name, which is additionally conditioned on
// storage:file-path. A token minted at --safety-level dangerously-unrestricted
// carries every storage:files:* scope, so a 403 here almost always means the
// policy gate, not the scope gate — but the old message ("access denied to
// delete file") read like a token problem and dropped the response body that
// said otherwise, which is how github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl#344 reached
// support as a missing-scope bug.
//
// verb is the user-facing operation ("delete"/"write"), permission the scope
// and IAM permission name, and cmdHint the command that verifies the scope gate.

	// Operation carries the "what", Message the server's "why" — diagnostic.Error
	// renders them as "Failed to <operation> (HTTP 403): <message>", so repeating
	// the path in both would read twice.
