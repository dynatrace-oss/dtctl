// SettingsForbidden builds the 403 error for a Settings 2.0 object operation.

// It is the Settings-API counterpart of the Grail-file 403 handling added for
// github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl#344, and exists for the same reason: the OAuth
// scope in the token and the IAM permission of the same name are two
// independent gates, so "access denied" without the server's explanation reads
// like a token problem even when the token is fine. Per the settings service
// definition, settings:objects:read and settings:objects:write are IAM
// permissions conditioned on settings:schemaId, settings:schemaGroup and
// settings:scope among others — which is why access to one schema says nothing
// about access to another.
//
// This lives in diagnostic rather than next to a handler because four resource
// packages (aws/azure/gcp connections, anomaly detectors) share the Settings
// API and would otherwise each carry a copy. The Grail-file equivalent stays in
// pkg/resources/lookup, which is its only caller.
