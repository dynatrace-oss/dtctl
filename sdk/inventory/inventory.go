// Package inventory probes a Dynatrace environment for what data actually
// exists there: which Grail data objects are fetchable, which buckets and
// entity types are present, which capabilities (spans, RUM, k8s, cloud
// integrations, …) are backed by live evidence — and which are absent, with
// the evidence cited. The capability set is defined declaratively and is
// user-extensible (see Definitions).
//
// Everything here is read-only: discovery runs a small, budgeted battery of
// DQL queries and returns a report; nothing is persisted.
//
// The package is execution-agnostic: discovery drives every query through the
// Runner interface, so any DQL executor — the dtctl CLI, a backend service
// with its own query client — can embed it without further dependencies.

//     hold at least one record (an empty stream is absent, not present)
//   - EntityTypes: at least one entity of a matching type (glob patterns) is in
//     the live topology census
//   - MetricKey: at least one key matching the glob is in the metric catalog
//   - Probe (+ Window): a DQL probe returns at least one row — weak evidence,
//     since absence of events is not absence of capability
//

// negatives are strong. Exactly one shape must be set.
