// This file is the Runner author's half of the contract.
//
// Discover drives every probe through a Runner, which means the quality of
// several verdicts depends on how faithfully the Runner translates a Grail
// response into a RunResult. Two of those translations are not obvious, and
// getting them wrong does not produce an error — it produces a confident wrong
// answer:
//
//   - ColumnTypes decides whether a metric family reports "n/a" (the scope
//     names a dimension this metric does not have) or "empty" (it has the
//     dimension and simply produced nothing). A Runner that leaves it nil
//     silently converts every n/a into an empty, which blames a source for a
//     question that was never askable of it — the exact failure this package
//     went out of its way to eliminate.
//   - TruncationCause decides whether a capped probe can name the limit that
//     stopped it and the remedy that applies.
//
// Rather than document those as rules to follow, the helpers below do the
// translation, so a Runner over the Dynatrace query API can hand the response
// straight through. See RunResult.

// ColumnTypesOf flattens the query API's per-index-range type blocks into the
// single column→type map RunResult carries.
//
// A response describes types per record-index range, and the same column can
// be described more than once — typically as a real type in one range and as
// "undefined" in another, when only some records carry the field. A known type
// therefore wins: "this column exists somewhere in the result" is the claim the
// applicability probe needs, and letting an undefined range overwrite it would
// invent a missing field.
