// Sampled recovery from the scan cap.
//
// On a high-volume tenant the scan cap is the dominant source of "unknown":
// the probe for logs or spans would scan more than --scan-limit-gbytes inside
// the window, so it is stopped before it can count, and the signal the
// operator came to check is exactly the one that gets no verdict. Narrowing
// --since only helps if it is narrowed below the point where the question is
// still worth asking.
//
// Grail's `samplingRatio` is the one lever that reduces the *scan* rather than
// the result: measured on a large tenant, an unscoped 15-minute count of logs
// scanned 500 GB (capped, partial) unsampled, 14.4 GB at 1-in-1000, and 0.18 GB
// at 1-in-100000 — and the scoped form of the same probe fell from 341 GB to
// 0.92 GB while landing within 1.5% of the true count. Aggregation cannot do
// that; it still scans everything.
//
// What makes this usable for arrival verification is an asymmetry. Sampling
// only ever drops records, so a sampled *hit* proves arrival at any ratio: it
// is as conclusive as an exhaustive one. A sampled *miss* proves much less. So
// the ladder below does not converge on precision — it stops at the first
// conclusive answer, which is usually the very first and cheapest rung.
//
// The error that remains scales inversely with volume, and the scan cap only
// binds on high volume, so the two failure modes barely overlap: the signals
// sampling is imprecise about are the ones that never needed it.

// samplingLadder is the sequence of ratios the recovery walks, most aggressive
// first. Only the decades are real: Grail rounds every ratio *down* to a power
// of ten (300 becomes 100, 2 becomes 1) and caps at 100000, so there is no
// finer step to take and asking for one silently gets a coarser probe than the
// evidence would claim.
//
// Descending is what makes the walk affordable. A hit ends it, so the common
// case costs one near-free query; each further rung costs roughly ten times the
// last, and the walk stops as soon as a rung is itself cut short by the cap. The
// total is therefore bounded at a little over one cap's worth of scan, not one
// per rung.

// divided by the number of sampled records — which the measurements bear out:
// 11 sampled records over 15 minutes put last-seen 91s behind the truth, while
// 676 put it within a second. At 30 records the bias is a thirtieth of the
