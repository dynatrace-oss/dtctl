// TestSinceVersionsNameNoReleaseBeyondTheNextOne is the tree-side half of the
// guard on the one part of the manifest a release can falsify on its own.
//
// A since-version is a claim about a release: `experimental since 0.39.0` tells
// a caller which version withdrew the guarantee. A declaration is written
// before that release exists, so it can name a release that never comes -- an
// extra release in between, a different bump than release-please's
// bump-minor-pre-major produced -- and the manifest would then be wrong in the
// direction that matters: it would understate how long the surface was still
// guaranteed.
//
// This test sees only the tree, so it checks what the tree alone can decide: a
// since-version must be a version, and it must be a release that has either
// already happened (at or below pkg/version.Version) or is the next one (the
// next patch or the next minor). Anything further out names a release nobody
// can know the number of yet.
//
// What it cannot decide is whether a since-version is *correct for the change
// that introduced it*, because that needs to know what the tree looked like
// before. An earlier version of this test tried -- it allowed only this release
// or the next one -- and so failed permanently on the first commit after every
// release, rejecting declarations that had shipped in exactly the release they
// name. That half lives in scripts/stability/check_compat.py (`make
// stability-compat`), which compares against the base branch: a declaration
// that is new or changed must name the next release rather than one that
// already shipped without it, a released one may not be rewritten, and one that
// names a not-yet-released version must still match the release being cut, so
// a differently-numbered release fails on release-please's own version-bump PR.
