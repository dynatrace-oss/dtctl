"""Reject a change that withdraws stable surface or misdates a since-version.

The checked-in manifest is gated for *freshness*: `go test ./test/stability/`
fails when `docs/STABILITY.md` disagrees with the command tree. That catches an
undeclared change, but it cannot catch a declared one -- delete a stable flag,
run `make stability-manifest`, commit the regenerated file, and the gate is
green again. The promise the manifest exists to record would then be broken by
the very commit that updated the record of it.

So this compares the manifest against its state on another ref (the PR base, or
the last release) and refuses two transitions:

  * a stable entry disappearing -- unless it was deprecated on the base, which
    is exactly the cycle a stable removal is supposed to go through;
  * a stable entry coming back weaker, which is a demotion and always needs a
    major release rather than a manifest regeneration.

Promotions, additions, and anything below stable are free: the tiers below
stable promise nothing, and this check exists to protect a promise.

It also owns the half of the since-version guard that needs the base to decide.
`experimental since 0.39.0` is a claim about which release changed the
contract. test/stability can only check that a since-version names a release
that already happened or is the next one; whether it is the *right* release
depends on what the base looked like. Three more things are refused here:

  * a since-version that is new or changed relative to the base but names a
    release that had already shipped at the base -- that release went out
    without the change, so the claim is false from the start;
  * a released since-version rewritten (to any version) or removed while its
    entry keeps its tier -- the change it records is history, and a different
    number, or none, misdates it;
  * a since-version naming a release the base had not reached that is not this
    release or the next one by the head's pkg/version -- on release-please's
    version-bump PR, that is a declaration written for a release that is now
    being numbered differently.

"Shipped at the base" means at or below the base's pkg/version.Version, which
release-please bumps only in the release commit itself.
