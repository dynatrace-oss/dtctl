"""Validate the hand-authored parts of docs/ against the real CLI.

`make docs-generate` + the docs-generate workflow only guard the
`<!-- GENERATED:x:start/end -->` blocks. Everything outside them -- overviews,
examples, notes, cross-links -- is prose, and prose is where the wrong flags
live: a docs migration shipped `dtctl apply --diff` (the flag is `--show-diff`),
a `DTCTL_ENVIRONMENT` variable that does not exist, and five relative links
missing their `.md`.

Three checks, all cheap:

  commands   every ``dtctl <...>`` in the docs resolves to a real command path,
             and every long flag on it is accepted by that command's own --help.
  links      every relative markdown link resolves on disk, and every `#anchor`
             matches a heading in the target file.
  redirects  every page of the retired docs/site/ is still a redirect stub, and
             still points at a repo doc that exists.

Usage:  check_prose.py <path-to-dtctl-binary> [docs-dir]
Exit 0 when clean, 1 with a per-finding report otherwise.
